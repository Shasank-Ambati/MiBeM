    <h1>Mineral Beneficiation</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Minerals and Ores</h3>
    <h4>What is a Mineral?</h4>
    <p>Minerals by definition are natural inorganic substances possessing definite chemical compositions and atomic structures. Some flexibility, however, is allowed in this definition.</p>
    <h4>Isomorphism in Minerals</h4>
    <p>Many minerals exhibit Isomorphism, where the substitution of atoms within the crystal structure by similar atoms takes place without affecting the atomic structure.</p> 
	<p>The mineral olivine, for example, has the chemical composition (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, but the ratio of Mg atoms to Fe atoms varies in different olivines, however, has the same ratio as that of the Si and O atoms.</p>
    <h4>Polymorphism in Minerals</h4>
    <p>Minerals can also exhibit polymorphism, with different minerals having the same chemical composition, but markedly different physical properties due to a difference in crystal structure.</p>
	<p>Thus, the two minerals graphite and diamond have exactly the same composition, being composed entirely of carbon atoms, but have widely different properties due to the arrangement of the carbon atom within the crystal lattice.</p>
    <h4>Generalized Definition of Minerals</h4>
    <p> The term “mineral” is often used in a much more extended sense to include anything of economic value which is extracted from the earth. Thus, coal, chalk, clay, and granite do not come within the definition of a mineral, although details of their production are usually included In national figures for mineral production. Such materials are, in fact, rocks, which are not homogeneous in chemical and physical composition, as are minerals, and form large parts of the earth’s crust. For instance, granite, which is one of the most abundant igneous rocks, i.e., a rock formed by the cooling of molten material, or magma, within the earth’s crust, is composed of three main material constituents, feldspar, quartz, and mica. These three homogeneous mineral components occur in varying proportions in different parts of the same granite mass.</p>
    <h4>Coal</h4>
    <p>Coals are not minerals in the geological sense, but a group of bedded rocks formed by the accumulation of vegetable matter. Most coal seams were formed over 300 million years ago by the decomposition of vegetable matter from the dense tropical forests which covered certain areas of the earth.</p>
    <h4>Formation of Coal</h4>
    <p>During the early formation of the coal seams, the rotting vegetation formed thick beds of peat, an unconsolidated product of the decomposition of vegetation, found in marshes and bogs. This later became overlain with shales, sandstones, mud, and silt, and under the action of the increasing pressure and temperature and time, the peat beds became altered, or metamorphosed, to produce the sedimentary rock known as coal. The degree of alteration is known as the rank of the coal, the lowest ranks (Lignite or brown coal) show little alteration, while the highest rank (anthracite) Is almost pure graphite (carbon).</p>
